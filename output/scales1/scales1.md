# One scale

A pattern based on a single scale seems to always end up stabilizing. It reaches a stable form quicker if the increment is larger. In general, the increment can be seen as the evolution speed of a scale. The examples below are classified as (activator radius/inhibitor radius/increment) and were generated with an image resolution of 480p. They show the stable form of the pattern.

## Big maze (100/200/0.05)
If the activator and inhibitor radii are large, the end pattern has wide shapes. With an activator radius smaller than the inhibitor radius, the shapes tend to look like mazes.

## Small maze (25/50/0.05)
Smaller radii give narrower, more detailed shapes.

## Big stripes (200/100/0.05)
An activator radius larger than the inhibitor radius produces more regular patterns without mazes.

## Small stripes (50/25/0.05)
Again, smaller radii generate narrower shapes.

## Piebald (10/200/0.05)
An activator radius much smaller than the inhibitor radius gives a sort of piebald pattern.

## Zoned stripes (200/10/0.05)
If the activator radius is much larger than the inhibitor radius, we get striped patterns with horizontal/vertical zones.

Finally, if both radii are equal, they cancel each other out and the image does not evolve at all.
